Flowers are the reproductive structures of flowering plants (angiosperms), and they come in a wide variety of colors, shapes, and sizes. They play a vital role in plant reproduction by attracting pollinators, such as insects and birds, to transfer pollen. Flowers also provide nectar and pollen as a food source for many animals.
